README for the iOS portion of the Garage project

Files here are used to build an iOS application called Garage. In the original submission, the code will only connect to io.adafruit.com as MQTT broker.

The iOS app is intended to be used with the Adabox003 Garage Door tutorial described here:

This code has dependencies on CocoaMQTT
